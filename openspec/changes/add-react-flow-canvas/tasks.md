## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Build a React Flow canvas component that consumes `useTraceLayout` and renders nodes/edges with pan/zoom enabled.
- [x] 1.2 Add swimlane backgrounds per location (striped or tinted rows) aligned with lane heights.
- [x] 1.3 Style nodes/edges with readable labels (agent/location/time) and stable IDs.
- [x] 1.4 Wire the default page to load the kitchen-sink trace data and display it via the canvas.

## 2. Validation
- [x] 2.1 Run lint/tests.
- [x] 2.2 Manual check: default page shows the seeded kitchen-sink trace with swimlane backgrounds and stable layout.
- [x] 2.3 Run `openspec validate add-react-flow-canvas --strict`.
